        BVNK provides stablecoin payments infrastructure, unifying banks and
        blockchains in a single platform to accelerate global money movement.
        While stablecoins offer compelling benefits like instant global
        settlement, businesses often struggle to integrate them at scale.

          BVNK's auto-conversion capabilities mean businesses don't need to
          touch stablecoins directly - they can hold funds in USD, GBP, or EUR
        </li>
        <li>
          Proprietary infrastructure and modular APIs work consistently across
          fiat and crypto, ensuring rapid integration and flexibility
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        BVNK partners with fintechs and enterprises who use their infrastructure
        to power global payment use cases:

          One of the world's largest merchant acquirers, Worldpay, uses BVNK's
          embedded wallets to enable instant global payouts in stablecoins for
          its clients - to partners, customers, contractors, creators, sellers
          across more than 180 markets. Payouts come from fiat balances, so
          there's no need for Worldpay or its clients to handle or hold crypto

          Employer of record platform Deel uses BVNK to pay more than 10,000
          freelancers in 100+ countries in stablecoins. Workers can opt to
          receive wage payments in stablecoins to ensure speedy payment and as a
          hedge against local currency inflation
        </li>
        <li>
          Digital asset finance platform Bitwave has partnered with BVNK to
          integrate stablecoin payments into its invoicing software, so its
          business customers can receive stablecoin payments from customers and
          auto-convert to fiat - or vice versa
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        BVNK's infrastructure connects major stablecoins with traditional
        banking capabilities, supported by regulatory licenses across multiple
        jurisdictions. The company recently launched Layer1, a self-custody
        infrastructure product that allows financial institutions to integrate
        stablecoin capabilities and orchestrate cross-border payments
        efficiently across both stablecoin and traditional payment rails.
      </p>

      <p>
        BVNK's approach of unifying traditional and blockchain financial systems
        positions it as a key enabler for the next phase of digital payment
        innovation.
