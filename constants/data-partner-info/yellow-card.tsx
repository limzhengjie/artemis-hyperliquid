        Yellow Card is the largest and first licensed stablecoin company in
        Africa, operating in 20 countries. We make it easy for individuals and
        businesses of all sizes to make international payments, protect their
        financial assets, manage their treasury function, and access hard
        currency liquidity. Our 25,000+ customers are primarily businesses using
        stablecoins for B2B payments.

        Stablecoins address critical issues with Africa's currency and banking
        systems. Over 70% of African countries face FX shortages declared as
        crises. In many markets, local bank debit cards can't be used
        internationally, banks can't process cross-border payments, and USD
        access is severely limited.

      <p>
        Stablecoins aren't replacing local currency transactions â€” they're
        replacing payments that previously relied on the SWIFT network, which is
        expensive, slow, and inefficient. Stablecoins offer a faster, cheaper,
        and simpler alternative.

        Yellow Card has facilitated over 5 billion in transactions. In economies
        like Nigeria, stablecoins have become essential for enabling USD
        payments without requiring hard currency to leave the country. Africa is
        ground zero for real-world, practical applications of stablecoins,
        crypto, and blockchain technology.
